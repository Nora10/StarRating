# Star Rating Component with React and Express Backend
This project demonstrates a simple full-stack application featuring a star rating system. The frontend is built with React, and the backend is managed by an Express server. Users can interactively rate by clicking on stars, which are highlighted on hover. The rating is saved to the backend when a star is clicked.

## Core Functionalities
**Interactive Star Rating**: Users can set a rating by clicking on one of the five stars displayed. The stars highlight when hovered over, indicating the potential rating before clicking.

**Persistent Ratings**: Ratings are sent to and stored on a server, making the rating persistent across sessions for demonstration purposes.

**Dynamic UI Updates**: The UI updates in real time as users hover over different stars and when they set a rating.

### How to Run
